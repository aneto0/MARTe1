Your system target file has included mdlvars.tlc.  The TLC entry \
points for Simulink Coder have changed to support multiple code formats, \
and mdlvars.tlc is now obsolete.

Please include codegenentry.tlc instead of mdlvars.tlc.

By default, codegenentry.tlc will generate the static real-time code \
format.  You can generate other code formats by assigning \
the TLC variable CodeFormat prior to including codegenentry.tlc.

To hook custom code into the model prior to code generation you \
should seperately include commonsetup.tlc and commonentry.tlc. \
For example, in your system target file

%<"%">assign CodeFormat = "RealTime"

%<"%">assign TargetType = "RT"
%<"%">assign Language   = "C"

%<"%">include "mylib.tlc"
%<"%">include "mygenmap.tlc"

%<"%">include "commonsetup.tlc"

%<"%">include "myhooks.tlc"

%<"%">include "commonentry.tlc"
