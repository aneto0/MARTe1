 * @brief Implementation of streamable type functions.
 * 
 * Implementation of streamable type functions for read, write and seek operations in buffered and unbuffered modes for streamable types
 * i.e files. Most of the functions depends from the virtual UnBuffered functions which must be implemented in the derived classes
 * because could be differents for different streamable types. 
 *
 * BufferedStream uses two IOBuffer in buffered modes, one for reading and one for writing operations and they are used togheter if the stream is defined as
 * readable, writable and seekable.*/ 


/**
  * @brief BufferedStream class.

    Replaces CStream and Streamable of BL1
    Inherits from pure virtual StreamInterface and does not resolve all pure virtual functions
   
    Uses the following StreamInterface methods to operate:
        CanRead  Read
        CanWrite Write
        CanSeek  Seek 
    But only allows using GetC and PutC as it masks the whole StreamInterface
    To use the whole StreamInterface one needs to implement safe versions of 
    all functions. This is left for for further class derivations. 

    Note also that this class supports partially or fully disabled buffering.
    Just set the buffer size to 0 and the buffer to NULL.

    It is a buffering mechanism for character streams
    It operates in 6 modes (+variants) depending on the Stream capabilities 
       CanSeek CanRead CanWrite
    and user Buffering choices

    1) Separate Buffering Output Mode
        CanWrite !CanSeek
        Used for devices where in and out streams are separate (for instance console )
        writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL && operatingMode.MutexBuffering() = False   
        !Can be combined with Separate Buffering Input Mode
    1a) writeBuffer.Buffer()== NULL just call directly StreamInterface::Write  

    2) Separate buffering Input Mode
        CanRead  !CanSeek
        Used for devices where in and out streams are separate (for instance console )
        readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  &&  operatingMode.mutexBuffering = False   
        !Can be combined with Separate Buffering Output Mode
    2a) readBuffer.Buffer()== NULL just call directly StreamInterface::Read  

    3) Dual separate buffers Input and Output Mode
        CanRead CanWrite !CanSeek
        Mode 1/1a and 2/2a combined

    4) Joint buffering Mode
        CanRead CanWrite CanSeek
        readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL && 
        operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = True   
        operatingMode.mutexWriteMode and
        operatingMode.mutexReadMode  determines whether the read 
        or write buffering is active
        Get and Put toggle the two flags
        everytime the flags are changed a proper Flush operation is 
        triggered to clean the buffers
    4a-b) one of readBuffer or writeBuffer is NULL
        same toggling of flags and flushing

    5) Joint buffering Read Only Mode
        CanRead !CanWrite CanSeek
        readBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()==NULL && 
        operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = false   
        Operates identically to mode 2 but cannot be active together
        with mode 6 
    5a) same as 2a

    6) Joint buffering Write Only Mode
        !CanRead CanWrite CanSeek
        readBuffer.Buffer()==NULL  && writeBuffer.Buffer()!=NULL && 
        operatingMode.mutexBuffering() = false   
        Operates identically to mode 1 but cannot be active together
        with mode 5
    6a) same as 1a
