 * @brief IOBuffer class.
 *
 * This class inherits from CharBuffer which represents a naked memory buffer with a pointer
 * at the beginning. It adds a movable pointer across the memory area and attributes
 * to get the size of the filled area and the readable area of the buffer.
 * 
 * This class implements basic methods for read, write and seek operations on the buffer which are virtual
 * to avoid overloading in descendents.
 *
 * The most important functions are the inline PutC and GetC which are used in Printf and GetToken
 * functions and are shared by all descendents (besides the implementation of NoMoreSpaceToWrite and 
 * NoMoreDataToRead depends on the specific derived class implementation)
