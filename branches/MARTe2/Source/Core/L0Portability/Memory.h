/**
 * @brief Allows functions to manage memory locations dinamically.  
 * 
 * Here are defined functions to allocate, reallocate and deallocate memory dinamically, 
 * other functions for the shared memory management which allows allocation of a memory  
 * accessible by more tasks and at last functions which allows copy, search, set and compare
 * memory areas.
 *
 * Most of the implementation is delegated to MemoryOS.h which provides system calls for the 
 * memory management that are different for each operating system.
 *
 * These methods are particularly useful in the implementation of functionality that requires
 * a dynamic management of the memory, like for example databases, static lists, streams ecc.
